# Logs for our group (Clem, Matt, Leon)

## Day 1
### November 28

Today we went through the first 2-3 tutorials (seperatly on our own computers). Collaboration will begin soon to produce a good level 4 
program. We will probably split up responsibility as to who programs which part of natural simulations, as well as deciding on a general
program that will be the main focus of our development (as in one specific program and set of files that will be uploaded here and updated
as we go). So far all three of us have the first two parts running, and clement started tutorial 3. Will update with more info tomorrow.
